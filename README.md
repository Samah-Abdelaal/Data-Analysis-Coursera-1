# Data-Analysis-Coursera-1
The final project of the "Introduction into Probability and Data" course on Coursera.

Identify a research question similar to questions weâ€™ve talked about in this course. 
Use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset.

Your project will consist of 3 parts:

Data: (3 points) 

Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, 
and the implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality). 
Note that you will need to look into documentation on the BRFSS to answer this question. 
See http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ as well as the "More information on the data" section below.

Research questions: (11 points) 

Come up with at least three research questions that you want to answer using these data. 
You should phrase your research questions in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. 
Make sure that at least two of these questions involve at least three variables. 
You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. 
With each question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.

EDA: (30 points) 

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses each of the three research questions you outlined above. 
Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. 
Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
